			<h1> TEACHING </h1>
			I teach on the following undergraduate courses :
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Cells to Organisms (CTO)</b> -- I maintain an online
			simulation of cell proliferation and differentiation,
			which students use in a ``dry'' practical. The students
			have to experiment with different division, death, and
			differentiation rates to produce robust populations of
			each cell type in appropriate proportions.
			<br>
			<br>

			<b>System Design Project (SDP)</b> -- I mentor a team of ~6
			students as they build a LEGO robot capable of playing
			football. The students build the physical robot from
			scratch, and also have to write their own sensing,
			planning, and control code.
			<br>
			<br>

			<b>Intelligent Autonomous Robotics (IAR)</b> -- I help my
			supervisor, Barbara Webb, run a series of practicals in
			which students must program a Khepera robot to perform
			tasks autonomously (i.e. without human intervention).
			Tasks include avoiding obstacles, performing odometry /
			dead reckoning, and collecting and returning ``food''
			to a ``nest''. 
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<b>General Neuroscience</b> -- 
			<br>
			<br>

			I also teach on the following masters-level courses :
			<br>
			<b>Introduction to Bioelectronics</b>

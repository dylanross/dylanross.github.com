      <p>Skhizein takes its name from the greek root meaning &ldquo;to split&rdquo;. The three pieces presented are investigate a central theme- the isolation from reality felt as somebody turns in on themselves. The artwork features an icebreaker ship stuck in ice- it has completely lost its function. At the time of writing the music, I had that feeling on an almost daily basis. To me, it&rsquo;s quite a claustrophobic sound.</p>
      <p>Many of the max for live devices found elsewhere on this site were developed during this period. These were some of my first pieces not to use any &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; sounds- everything you hear is originally taken from real instruments. </p>

    <div id="music_text_column_2">The Trains EP was my first serious electronic endeavour. I was getting to grips with ableton live, which lead to the EP’s somewhat loop-based nature.  The premise for this EP is quite simple- it’s a soundtrack for being in a train station or on a train. In these situations I feel both optimistic due to travelling, but also wary of the mass of strangers around me and the uncertainty ahead. </div>
    <div id="music_text_column_3">This release has a very personal theme. It deals with the emotions felt after the loss of a child. All of the pieces are improvised and have had no subsequent editing. The plan was to capture a raw, affecting sound. In preparation for the project I developed programming and hardware that would allow me to be much more &quot;hands-on&quot; with live creation of electronic music. I began utilising live guitar more regularly, and eventually I built my  prepared/ tabletop guitar which allows me to both interface with programming and produce interesting sounds for the programming to act upon with minimal keyboard and mouse use. This approach allowed me to realise my vision for the threnody- one of personal, emotional and relatable electronic music. </div>
